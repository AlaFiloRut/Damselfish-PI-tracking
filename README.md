# Damselfish-PI-tracking

Aim of this project is to understand whether Domino damselfish could be utilizing path integration (PI) as the navigation strategy over short distances. Three initial tests were run: 

- Path Integration test - checks whether fish use PI
- Control test - checks whether the fish return back to shelter
- Polarised light test - checks utilization of polarized light as a cue to obtain direction for path integration vector

All three (along with initial exploratory tests) will be edited, and tracked using MATLAB pipelines.
